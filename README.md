Have you ever been to bedrock, and you didn't want to dig back up? Have you ever been drowning and you just want to get it over with? Or maybe you just didn't want to give the water the satisfaction of killing you? Well then this mod is for you!

Notes:
- This is a client-side mod
- You do not need to activate cheats or use the console, unlike the "/kill" command
- Default keybinding is ',' or comma
- Keybinding setting in Options -> Controls -> Key Binds -> Killshot
- More configuration settings in Forge config screen
